# canvas-es6

Hi,

This is my repository to the Canvas lessons at Udacity. This is only for experimental sake and there is not much meaning. If you look at my code and think something is wrong or could be done better then please do not hesitate to inform me. 
Here is the [link](https://github.com/Lacika1981/canvas) to my repo where I used closures to solve this puzzle.
Here is the [link](https://github.com/Lacika1981/canvas-es5) to my repo where I used ES5 syntax to solve this puzzle.

Thank you
